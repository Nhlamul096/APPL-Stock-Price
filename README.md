# APPL-Stock-Price
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict AAPL stock prices over time using historical data. The model is built using Python, yfinance for data collection, and machine learning techniques for forecasting future stock prices.

#Key Features:
Historical Stock Data Collection: Utilizes the yfinance library to fetch Apple stock prices and analyze trends over time.
Machine Learning Model: Implements a predictive model (e.g., linear regression, LSTM, etc.) trained on past stock prices to forecast future prices.
30-Day Price Forecasting: Predicts Apple stock prices for the next 30 days using the trained model.
Investment Simulation: Simulates how much an investment made at a specific date in the past would be worth today, based on both actual and predicted stock prices.
Data Visualization: Plots actual vs. predicted stock prices and visualizes future price forecasts.

#Technologies Used:
Python: Core language for implementing the model.
yfinance: Fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Used for building the machine learning model.
Matplotlib: For visualizing stock price trends and predictions.

#How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Run the script to fetch Apple stock data and build the predictive model.
Use the trained model to forecast future stock prices and simulate investments.
